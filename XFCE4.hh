If you're just here to use crouton, you can grab the Version Imgur from https://goo.gl/fd3zc. Download it, pop open a shell (Ctrl+Alt+T, type shell and hit enter), make the installer executable with sudo install -Dt /usr/local/bin -m 755 ~/Downloads/crouton, then launch it with sudo crouton to see the help text. See the "examples" section for some usage examples.
Then Type  sudo startxfce4.
